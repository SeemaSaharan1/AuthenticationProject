# AuthenticationProject
I have developed a basic authentication system with user registration and login functionalities using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for securing the endpoints.


To use it properly add your database credential into .env file.

Endpoints such as http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile work well once you have completed the whole setup.
